# Merge-Sort-
A C++ implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm, developed as part of a Data Structures project. Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm used for sorting elements with a time complexity of O(n log n).

## Features

- Implements Merge Sort algorithm
- Supports sorting of integer arrays
- Demonstrates recursive divide-and-conquer technique
- Includes clear and concise output for sorted data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and command-line operations

###  Sample Output
Original Array: 5 2 4 7 1 3 6 8
Sorted Array:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
